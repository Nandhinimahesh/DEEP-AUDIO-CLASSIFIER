# DEEP-AUDIO-CLASSIFIER

A deep audio classifier using heart sounds can be used to classify different types of heart sounds, such as normal heart sounds, murmurs, and abnormal heart sounds. To build such a classifier, you can use deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

Here are the general steps you can take to build a deep audio classifier using heart sounds:

1)Collect heart sound data: Collect a large dataset of heart sound recordings that includes different types of heart sounds, such as normal heart sounds, murmurs, and abnormal heart sounds.

2)Preprocess the data: Preprocess the heart sound recordings to remove noise and normalize the audio. You may also want to segment the audio into smaller chunks, such as one-second clips, to make it easier to feed into the deep learning model.

3)Train a deep learning model: Train a deep learning model using the preprocessed heart sound data. You can use a combination of CNNs and RNNs to capture both the spectral and temporal features of the heart sounds. You may also want to use transfer learning by fine-tuning pre-trained models, that were originally trained on image classification tasks.

4)Evaluate the model: Evaluate the performance of the deep learning model on a validation dataset. You can also use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance.

5)Test the model: Test the deep learning model on a separate test dataset to evaluate its real-world performance.

6)Deploy the model: Once you are satisfied with the performance of the deep learning model, you can deploy it in a real-world application, such as a mobile app or a web service, to classify heart sounds in real-time.
